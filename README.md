# YaST2 slide show texts

The slide show for the installation is generated from slideshow.xml by
converting all sections to separate rich text files. The files are
named according to the section labels. YaST reads them in
alphabetical order so it's recommended to name them e.g
'01_welcome', '02_whatever', etc. YaST also shows an image alongside
the text. The image files in the 'pic/' directory have to be in png
format and named according to the section label, ie 01_welcome.png,
02_whatever.png etc.
