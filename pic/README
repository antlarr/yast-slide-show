			    YaST2 Slide Show Images
                           =========================

Starting with SuSE Linux 9.2 (Aug/Sep 2004), the image files are no longer the
master; rather, any images are included in the text with HTML-like "img src"
tags.

Since normally each slide show page will contain one image, it still makes
sense (but it is no longer mandatory) to name the images according to the
respective text file, thus using something like "01_welcome.png" for a text
file "01_welcome.rtf".
